# PrimeNumberIteration
This java program takes an integer, then checks if it is a prime number or a composite number.
It does this using two different methods:
1. Throught an iterations of every interger between 1 and the number, in other to find it's factors
2. Through the use of Miller-Rabin algorithm.

All checks, factors and lowest factors are printed to screen.
