# PrimeNumberIteration
This java program takes an integer, then checks if it is a prime number or a composite number.
It does this using two different methods:
1. Throught an iterations of every interger between 1 and the number, in other to find it's factors
2. Through the use of Miller-Rabin algorithm.

It is important to note that this code contains other methos and functions that had been commented out in order to fit the lecturer's demands.
All checks and factors are printed to screen.
